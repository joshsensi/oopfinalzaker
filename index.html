    <h1>FINAL PROJECT: Mystic Slots </h1>
		<h3>By: Josh Zaker</h3>
		<p>This is the first update for my final project! this is during spirnt 5 so we still got time. </p>
    <p>This will be a game aplication in the form of slots where you can gamble an ingame currency to win prizes. </p>
    <p>It will be a goodlooking slot machine game with popup menues for prizes as well as the game itself. </p>
    <p>I am going to prioritize the use of an ingame currency and develope a way to have it flow evenly through betting and using the money on prizes</p>
    <p>I will also prioritize menue uses and buttions i plan on having multiple choices even in betting as well as perminite prizes on display</p>
    <p>I am not prioritizing this but think it would be cool if i hook an ardwino up to it and make accuall buttions to enhance the experiance of the slot machine</p>
    <p>I will be coding mainly in java but will use c++ for the ardwino work as well as python for any animation because its easier to code animation in pythin.</p>
    <p>Like i said i will be using alot of buttons as well as graphical interfaces and random generation. </p>
		<h3>I am very excited for all this:)</h3>
